# Contributing

Pull requests are very welcome, but should be within the scope of the project, and follow the repository's code conventions. Before submitting a pull request, it's always good to file an issue, so we can discuss the details of the PR.

## Reporting a Bug

1. Ensure you've replicated the issue against `main`. There is a chance the issue may have already been fixed.

2. Search for any similar issues (both opened and closed). There is a chance someone may have reported it already.

3. Provide a demo of the bug isolated in a codesandbox.io. Sometimes this is not a possibility, in which case provide a detailed description along with any code snippets that would help in triaging the issue. If we cannot reproduce it, we will close it.

4. The best way to demonstrate a bug is to build a failing test. This is not required, however, it will generally speed up the development process.

## Submitting a pull request

1. [Fork](https://github.com/formatjs/formatjs/fork/) the repository.

1. Ensure that all tests are passing prior to submitting.

1. If you are adding new functionality, or fixing a bug, provide test coverage.

1. Follow syntax guidelines detailed below.

1. Push the changes to your fork and submit a pull request. If this resolves any issues, please mark in the body `fix #ID` within the body of your pull request. This allows for github to automatically close the related issue once the pull request is merged.

1. Last step, [submit the pull request](https://github.com/formatjs/formatjs/compare/)!

## Development

### Requirements

- [`bazel`](https://bazel.build/)
- [`docker`](https://www.docker.com/)

You can build & test with `pnpm`:

```sh
pnpm i && pnpm t
```

To run examples:

```sh
npm run examples
```

Releases can be done with the following steps:

```sh
# Make sure you have GH_TOKEN setup as indicated by:
# https://github.com/lerna/lerna/blob/05ad1860e2da7fc16c9c0a072c9389e94792ab64/commands/version/README.md#--create-release-type
npm run prerelease
bazel build :dist
mkdir ../formatjs2
cp -rf dist/bin/formatjs_dist/ ../formatjs2/
cd ../formatjs2/
npx pnpm -r publish
```

### Updating tzdata version

1. Change `IANA_TZ_VERSION` in WORKSPACE to the desired version

1. Update the sha512 for tzdata & tzcode targets

1. Potentially update tz data

```
bazel run //packages/intl-datetimeformat:generated_tz_data
```

### Generating CLDR data

1. Check out `./BUILD` file for generatable data — which are identifiable via `generate_src_file()` call
   ```BUILD
   generate_src_file(
     name = "regex",
     ...
   )
   ```
2. Create an empty file with the given `src` attribute — path is relative to module root
   ```shell
   touch packages/icu-messageformat-parser/regex.generated.ts
   ```
3. Run update script
   ```shell
   bazel run //packages/icu-messageformat-parser:regex.update
   ```
4. Verify
   ```shell
   bazel run //packages/icu-messageformat-parser:regex
   ```
