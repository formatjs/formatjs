While you can declare your messages using only `id`s, we highly recommend declaring `defaultMessage`s inline along with their usages because of the following reasons:

1. Messages colocated with their usages become self-managed, as their usages change/removed, so are the messages.
2. Messages are highly contextual. We've seen a lot of cases where developers assume a certain grammar when they write their messages. Buttons/Call-To-Actions and labels are also translated differently.
3. Text styling is also dependent on the message itself. Things like truncation, capitalization... certainly affect the messages themselves.
4. Better integrations with toolchains. Most toolchains cannot verify cross-file references to validate syntax/usage.

At a high level, formatjs messages use [ICU Syntax](/docs/core-concepts/icu-syntax) with a couple of enhancements common in other message format such as [Fluent](https://github.com/projectfluent/fluent.js/). This section focuses on the actual supported ways of calling `formatjs` APIs so messages can be extracted.

## Using imperative API `intl.formatMessage`

```tsx
// Method must be exactly `intl.formatMessage`
intl.formatMessage(
  {
    description: 'A message', // Description should be a string literal
    defaultMessage: 'My name is {name}', // Message should be a string literal
  },
  {
    name: userName,
  } // Values should be an object literal, but not necessarily every value inside
)
```

## Using React API `<FormattedMessage/>`

```tsx
<FormattedMessage
  description="A message" // Description should be a string literal
  defaultMessage="My name is {name}" // Message should be a string literal
  values={
    {
      name: userName,
    } // Values should be an object literal, but not necessarily every value inside
  }
/>
```

## Using Vue API & template methods such as `$formatMessage`

```vue
<template>
  <p>{{ $formatNumber(3, {style: 'currency', currency: 'USD'}) }}</p>
</template>
```

## Pre-declaring using `defineMessage` for later consumption (less recommended)

```tsx
const message = defineMessage({
  description: 'A message', // Description should be a string literal
  defaultMessage: 'My name is {name}', // Message should be a string literal
})

intl.formatMessage(message, {name: 'John'}) // My name is John

<FormattedMessage
  {...message}
  values={{
    name: 'John',
  }}
/> // My name is John
```

<Admonition type="caution">
  We rely on AST to extract messages from the codebase, so make sure you call
  `intl.formatMessage()`, use our builtin React components, use our Vue methods
  or configure `--additionalFunctionNames`/`--additionalComponentNames` in our
  [CLI](/docs/tooling/cli) properly.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="caution">
  You can declare a message without immediately formatting it with
  `defineMessage` and our extractor would still be able to extract it. However,
  our [enforce-placeholders](/docs/tooling/linter#enforce-placeholders) linter
  rule won't be able to analyze it.
