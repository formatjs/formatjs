# Bazel will create symlinks from the workspace directory to output artifacts.
# Build results will be placed in a directory called "dist/bin"
# Other directories will be created like "dist/testlogs"
# Be aware that this will still create a bazel-out symlink in
# your project directory, which you must exclude from version control and your
# editor's search path.
build --symlink_prefix=dist/
# To disable the symlinks altogether (including bazel-out) you can use
# build --symlink_prefix=/
# however this makes it harder to find outputs.

# Specifies desired output mode for running tests.
# Valid values are
#   'summary' to output only test status summary
#   'errors' to also print test logs for failed tests
#   'all' to print logs for all tests
#   'streamed' to output logs for all tests in real time
#     (this will force tests to be executed locally one at a time regardless of --test_strategy value).
test --test_output=errors

# Support for debugging NodeJS tests
# Add the Bazel option `--config=debug` to enable this
# --test_output=streamed
#     Stream stdout/stderr output from each test in real-time.
#     See https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/user-manual.html#flag--test_output for more details.
# --test_strategy=exclusive
#     Run one test at a time.
# --test_timeout=9999
#     Prevent long running tests from timing out
#     See https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/user-manual.html#flag--test_timeout for more details.
# --nocache_test_results
#     Always run tests
# --node_options=--inspect-brk
#     Pass the --inspect-brk option to all tests which enables the node inspector agent.
#     See https://nodejs.org/de/docs/guides/debugging-getting-started/#command-line-options for more details.
# --define=VERBOSE_LOGS=1
#     Rules will output verbose logs if the VERBOSE_LOGS environment variable is set. `VERBOSE_LOGS` will be passed to
#     `nodejs_binary` and `nodejs_test` via the default value of the `default_env_vars` attribute of those rules.
# --compilation_mode=dbg
#     Rules may change their build outputs if the compilation mode is set to dbg. For example,
#     mininfiers such as terser may make their output more human readable when this is set. Rules will pass `COMPILATION_MODE`
#     to `nodejs_binary` executables via the actions.run env attribute.
#     See https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/user-manual.html#flag--compilation_mode for more details.
test:debug --test_output=streamed --test_strategy=exclusive --test_timeout=9999 --nocache_test_results --define=VERBOSE_LOGS=1
# Use bazel run with `--config=debug` to turn on the NodeJS inspector agent.
# The node process will break before user code starts and wait for the debugger to connect.
run:debug --define=VERBOSE_LOGS=1 -- --node_options=--inspect-brk
# The following option will change the build output of certain rules such as terser and may not be desirable in all cases
build:debug --compilation_mode=dbg

# Turn off legacy external runfiles

# This flag is needed to so that the bazel cache is not invalidated
# when running bazel via `yarn bazel`.
