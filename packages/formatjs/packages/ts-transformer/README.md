# @formatjs/ts-transformer

[![npm version](https://badgen.net/npm/v/@formatjs/ts-transformer)](https://badgen.net/npm/v/@formatjs/ts-transformer)

Extracts string messages for translation from modules that use React Intl (similar to [`babel-plugin-react-intl`](https://github.com/formatjs/formatjs/tree/master/packages/babel-plugin-react-intl)).

Take a look at [`compile.ts`](compile.ts) for example in integration.
