"Usage: formatjs compile-folder [options] <folder> <outFolder>

Batch compile all extracted translation JSON files in <folder> to <outFolder>
containing react-intl consumable JSON. We also verify that the messages are
valid ICU and not malformed.

Options:
  --format <path>                 Path to a formatter file that converts JSON files in \`<folder>\` to \`Record<string, string>\` so we can compile. The file must export a function named \`compile\` with the signature:
  \`\`\`
  type CompileFn = <T = Record<string, MessageDescriptor>>(
    msgs: T
  ) => Record<string, string>;
  \`\`\`
  This is especially useful to convert from a TMS-specific format back to react-intl format
  
  --ast                           Whether to compile to AST. See
                                  https://formatjs.github.io/docs/guides/advanced-usage#pre-parsing-messages
                                  for more information
  --skip-errors                   Whether to continue compiling messages after
                                  encountering an error. Any keys with errors
                                  will not be included in the output file.
  --pseudo-locale <pseudoLocale>  Whether to generate pseudo-locale files. See
                                  https://formatjs.github.io/docs/tooling/cli#--pseudo-locale-pseudolocale
                                  for possible values. "--ast" is required for
                                  this to work.
  --ignore-tag                    Whether the parser to treat HTML/XML tags as
                                  string literal instead of parsing them as tag
                                  token. When this is false we only allow simple
                                  tags without any attributes.
  -h, --help                      display help for command
